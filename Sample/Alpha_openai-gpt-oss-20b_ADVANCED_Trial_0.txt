[Q #1]
I am currently in Room Alpha facing wall 0, which is Northeast. What room is behind me?

You’re looking out toward the Northeast side of Alpha, so your back faces the Southwest.  
In the layout, Alpha’s Southwest side isn’t connected to any other listed room – it simply borders the interior of Alpha itself. So there is no separate room “behind you”; you’re still in Room Alpha.

You’re looking at Wall 0 of Room Alpha, which faces **Northeast**.  
The wall on your left side is **Wall 3**, and that wall opens onto the room whose connection matches Alpha’s **Northwest** corner – namely **Room Charlie**.
